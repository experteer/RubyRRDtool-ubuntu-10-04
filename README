== Introduction 

rubyrrdtool provides ruby bindings for RRD functions (via librrd), with
functionality comparable to the native perl bindings. See examples/minmax.rb
or the unit tests in the test directory for scripts that exercise the
rrdtool functions. 


== Installation

rubyrrdtool requires RRDtool version 1.2 or later. Some RRD functions such
as rrddump are only available with the latest RRDtool.

Installation is standard. If you've installed the gem, you should be ready
to go. Otherwise, simply run:

ruby extconf.rb
make
make install

I hope this works for you.  Please let me know if you have any problems or
suggestions.

Thanks to Tobi for rrdtool!
